# Web-Fundamentals-Teamwork-Assignment  
We use the http://html5reset.org/ set of files structure that uses the best practices and style reset for most browsers.  
This project is located here https://github.com/murtaugh/HTML5-Reset  
  
We also use the Twitter framework located here https://github.com/twbs/bootstrapframework  
This gave us the structure of page layout, grid, forms, buttons, tables and menus.
